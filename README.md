Experiment Simple Vehicle Model

***This project is part of AVE3 pratical course for Modelling and Simulation.
This experiment is to develope a simple vehicle model going up and down a slope in a purely longitudinal manner.
The underlying system is a mix between electrical and mechanical system.
The average voltage of the E-motor is set by an H-bridge where the differential equation for electrical system is calculated.
The complete parameterisation of the DC motor model is done with a look up table for resistance losses by H-bridge..
DC motor subsystem is connected to the vehicle model for transformation to mechanical system.
Rolling resistance is calculated for two different types of tyres (teflon and metal).
The model is validated via experimental data.
